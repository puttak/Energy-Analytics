# Energy-Analytics
Projects worked on during my NSC 323: Energy Analytics practicum course Fall 2019. Throughout this course, a team and I worked closely with employees of ConocoPhillips on real industry problem statements. We used machine learning and statistical analysis to make various business decisions based on oil data.
